## Assignment 4: Choose Your Adventure Story

### Story Summary

A short horror story about trying to find your missing friend who went camping. I went with this in particular because I really enjoy analog horror and how it looks in a pure text format.

### Key Takeaways

Html is the main foundation of a webpage and can be further enhanced through things like CSS and Javascript. CSS can be used to technically style both and make the website look how you want. Javascript manages interactivity of the webpage through various means and depending on how it is coded can even take one choice and make it effect another. It can also style the webpage outside of CSS, even making the change temporary.
